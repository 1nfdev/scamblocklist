A blocklist to protect users against untrustworthy retail sites.

Special shoutout to `www.ikiha.com` for inspiring the creation of this project (included in this blocklist). All I wanted was the chubby seal plushie.

## How to Use

Scam Blocklist URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durablenapkin/scamblocklist/master/hosts.txt`

In uBlock Origin ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) | [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)) you can add the Scam Blocklist URL as a `Custom Filter List`.

Otherwise, the Scam Blocklist is compatible with other adblockers - such as OpenWRT adblock/simple-adblock, Pi-hole - and can easily be added as another list.
