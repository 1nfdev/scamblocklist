## How to Use

The Scam Blocklist can easily be added as another list in adblockers. In uBlock Origin ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) | [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)) you can add it as a `Custom Filter List` under the `Filter lists` tab.
